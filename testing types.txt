Unit testing: This involves testing individual units or components of code to ensure that they function correctly in isolation.

Integration testing involves testing how different components or modules of a system work together.

Functional testing: This involves testing the system against its functional requirements to ensure that it meets the expected behavior.

Performance testing: This involves testing the system's performance under different workloads to ensure that it can handle the expected traffic.

Security testing: This involves testing the system's security features and vulnerabilities to ensure that it is protected against possible attacks.

Acceptance testing: This involves testing the system with end-users or stakeholders to ensure that it meets their needs and requirements.

Regression testing: This involves testing to ensure that previously working features have not been affected by changes to the system.

Exploratory testing: This involves a less structured approach to testing, where testers explore the system and its behavior to identify issues that may not be apparent through other types of testing.
